# Example 02 - Creating your own translator based on Amazon Translate

Now let's go straight to the functionality by creating our own translator but... Before we go ahead let's do AWS Lambdas in a much better way: using the Serverless open-source framework!

PS. If you didn't follow the setup instructions to install Serverless Framework, here is the link: 

Serverless Framework allows you to write Lambda code in your computer and then deploy it to AWS Cloud like a boss. All the Lambda configuration are defined in the file [serverless.yml](./serverless.yml):

```yaml
service: w02-translate

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs8.10
  
  iamRoleStatements:
      - Effect: "Allow"
        Action:
          - "translate:*"
        Resource:
          - "*"
          
functions:
  translate:
    handler: translate.run
```

Let's start using by download all the workshop examples here: https://github.com/InternetOfHealthcare/serverless-workshop/archive/master.zip

Unzip this file and then you will see one directory for each example, let's jump into the number two by typing the following commands inside the workshop's zip directory:

```console
cd w02-translate
serverless deploy
```

### 1. Type "serverless deploy" to deploy your local code to AWS Cloud

### 2. To test your Lambda function (not in your computer!), just type "serverless invoke -f translate -l"

### 3. Now you can try to change and play with this code!
